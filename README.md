Containerized ETCD
==================================

ETCD is a openshource clustered key value store availaible from the guys
at CoreOS (https://coreos.com/) (https://github.com/coreos/etcd). ETCD 
uses Golang and is easy to get running even outside a container. What
we have done here is to package up the golang and ETCD and put them in
a Docker container that make it easy to deploy.
